## Shoot down an ambulance and grapple civilians in this Crazy Taxi-esque FPS with retro graphics!

### What if ambulances ran over people instead of helping them?

That's the question that led to this game's development. 

In Todwagon you play as a gangster, who, contrary to what their normal perceived role is, helps strangers who get run over by the evil ambulance in town. It takes place in a world in which medics are all evil villains and gangsters fill the role of a normal medic.
